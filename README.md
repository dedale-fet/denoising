# Denoise-Galaxy-Spectra
### **Code for Denoising of Spectroscopic Data**

1.  Introduction 

This repository contains MATLAB codes and scripts designed for Denoising of Spectroscopic Data. This directory contains both the primary functions and the user scripts that call these functions. 

2.  Dependencies 

In order to run the code, in this link [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fkvxjfor14k4hwu/AAB20Iz0LI84NBxCoK6V9cQca?dl=0) you can download the both the data, and the Coupled Dictionaries that are utilized for our sparse decomposition. 

3.  Execution

The primary script is **demo.m**, which is designed to take a sequence of observed, noisy spectral profiles, and attempt to reconstruct the ground truth spectra.
